*This libarby is going to be pretty in-flux for the time being as I migrate things around.

# ReplayAnalysisEngine

This repository will contain the implementation for my Replay Analysis Engine (RAE) for the Unity Game Engine with a django back end. I used to have some of this code listed at https://github.com/eharpste/Unity-Logger but that library stagnated for a while and never contained the server side of the equation. For the purposes of the url being listed in an archival paper I opted to leave the old repository and instead create this one to contain a broader set of the implementation of things. Most of my active work on the replayer actually lives in a private repo for the time being but I will migrate versions over as well as build a more useful backend implementaiton here.
